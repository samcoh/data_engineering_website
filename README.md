# Data Engineering Website for the Michihgan Daily Web Team
Final Project for SI 364
Website Link: http://dataengineering.pythonanywhere.com/

This is a public facing website for the Michigan Daily Data Engineering team. This web application displays all the work done by the team throughout the year. As well, it serves a functional purpose by allowing the organization to run more efficiently. Team members will be able to see what projects need to be worked on. As well, different departments can view the projects that data engineering is working on, projects that have been published in the paper, and it shows indiviudals who are working on the different projects displayed on the site.  Departments will be able to reach out to the team if they want to collaborate on a project being worked on. 

The website will allow logged-in end users to input different projects they are working on, enter in start dates and end dates when different steps of a project get completed, and information about themselves (i.e, email, phone number, birthday , major, minor, start date). 

The data that will be featured on the website is information about the people working on the team, data about projects and their progress, and if a project has been published in the Newspaper.
